Hi There,

I'm a former Systems Engineer looking to transition into Cyber Security. For the past few months I have been spending time upskilling in Cyber Security & managing a small business.

As part of my upskilling journey, I have recently obtained the OSCP certification after completing the PWK (Penetration Testing with Kali Linux) course. other certifications obtained during this time include the ITILv4, CompTIA Linux+ & CompTIA Security+.

I enjoy spending time doing CTF's on online platforms such as HackTheBox, tryhackme & Vulnhub to learn & gain practical hands-on experience on vulnerable applications/machines. For me Cyber Security is a hobby that i would like to turn it into a full time profession.
